# Gourds Fix

### _For when regular pumpkins just don't cut it_

## Description

This mod "fixes" Melons and Pumpkins (hence gourds) attachment to Stems by making the block rotatable. Also allows directional placement for decoration purposes.
This mod should be fine to be removed if needed, blocks will lose their rotation but other than that will remain.
Nevertheless, **always backup your world save first!**

## Description for nerds

This mod does exactly things:
 - Adds Facing property to Melons and Pumpkins grown blocks (thanks Statement library for making this possible!) 
 - Modifies Vanilla asset to respect said property and rotate the model
 - Sets the property after block is grown
 - Sets the property after block is placed by Player
